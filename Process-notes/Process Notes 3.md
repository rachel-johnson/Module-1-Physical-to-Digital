# Deciding on an Object
---

January 30, 2018

I knew that I needed to choose an object with some historical significance and that I would be excited to work with for the other Modules in the course:

- I knew we had some figurines from my Great Aunt and Uncle that looked interesting
- I examined the four figurines and discovered that they were all from the same British Company, Royal Doulton
- I decided to use the oldest figurine, a Toby Jug of Winston Churchill which was made in 1940 in England
