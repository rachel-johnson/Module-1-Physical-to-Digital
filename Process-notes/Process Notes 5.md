# Final Model

After finishing the 3D model using 71 photos, I returned to try to figure out how to use the 102 photos:

- I was able to align the masked photos of the Jug properly this time
- I then ran into an issue when trying to make the dense cloud point
    - I received a error message saying it couldn't find the point to process
    - I realized that the box wasn't around the aligned tie points
    - Once I moved the box and enlarged it to completely surround the points, I was able to create the dense cloud
- I then was able to follow the rest of the steps, building a mesh and adding texture
- I saved and exported the finished model to Sketchfab 
    - I found that the more photos used produced a more accurate 3D model, as the shape of the hat and the handle were more detailed in the 102 photo model than the 71 photo model
- I decided to submit both models in order to help show the different and my work overall
