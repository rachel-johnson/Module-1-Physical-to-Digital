# 3D Process: From Pictures to Model
---

February 1-4

Getting the Photos:
- I began by creating an area to properly scan the Churchill Toby Jug with the Trnio App
- I placed it on a stool which I could easily walk all the way around 
- The App stopped working for me, and after trying muliple times to use it on the Toby Jug I decided to use a DSLR camera instead
- I was able to take photos of the Jug from a consistent distance, pivoting the object slightly each time in order to get all sides and angles of it
- I then transfered the 113 photographs to my laptop to begin creating my 3D model

Editing the Photos:
- Once I had the photos on my laptop I played around with 3D Paint to isolate the object and erase the background in each photo
- I was able to use the "Magic Select" function to separate the Churchill Jug in each photo
- I then was able to use the eraser and fill tools to quickly remove the backgrounds in the 102 photos I decided to use

Finding a 3D program:
- At first I tried to use the Windows programs 3D Builder, but couldn't figure out how to use it with photographs
- I then found a free trial of Agisoft PhotoScan Pro, in order to use the program at home on my laptop
- I was able to successfully sign up for the free trial, and then download the program
- I found a Tutorial for how to make a 3D model using pictures on the PhotoScan website: http://www.agisoft.com/pdf/PS_1.1%20-Tutorial%20(BL)%20-%203D-model.pdf

Creating my 3D Model:
- I followed the tutorial step by step in order to make my model:
    - I began by uploading my 102 edited photos to PhotoScan
    - I then needed to created a mask of each one, in order to separate the object from the blank background
    - This took a while, as I was editing, uploading, and masking the photos simultaneously
    - Once the photos were all masked, I tried to align the photos
    - I didn't work that well, so I created another project in which I used on 71 of the 102 photos
    - The smaller project worked, so I then created a Dense Point Cloud which really helped me to begin visualizing the model
    - I then built a mesh from the point cloud and built texture onto the model after the mesh
- After completing all these steps, I was able to save and export the model

Exporting the Model:
- I created a sketchfab account in order to display my 3D model
- Once the model was finished in PhotoScan, I was able to export it directly to Sketchfab using my account API
