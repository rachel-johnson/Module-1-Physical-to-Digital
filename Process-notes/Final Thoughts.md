# Final Thoughts

February 4

After finishing my 3D models of the Winston Churchill Toby Jug, I have some reflection on the process:
- I really enjoyed entering Module 1 with no real knowledge of 3D modelling and having to figure things out as I went
- I found that once I found a program to use with a tutorial to follow it was not as difficult or daunting as I'd worried
- I needed to figure some parts out myself to problem solve, but was able to make it work
- My models didn't turn out perfect (which is okay)
    - The hat and handle especially ended up missing some aspects
    -  I'm sure that if given more time and some assistance I could figure out how to fix this
- I think that 3D modelling of artifacts and objects is a really useful tool, as it allows for a new perspective on the ways the medium changes the meaning of an object
    - I found that I began to really look closely at the original object, as I was working so long and closely with its photos and model and was able to see the ways in which the model changed the viewers perception of the object itself

I really like that the process is equally if not more important than the final result, as you can really learn a lot from the mistakes you encounter throughout the process to better understand the final result.
