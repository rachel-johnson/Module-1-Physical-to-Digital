# Trnio: First Use
January 18, 2018

I downloaded the Trnio app to use on my iPhone:

- I practised with some everyday objects in my house (an orange, water bottle, etc.)
- I found that I needed to be able to walk fully around the object to ensure it was all captured equally
- The objects with shiny parts were harder to record and the more textured ones were easier

# Trnio: Second Use

I went to the Museum of History in Hull to practice and try to decide on an artifact/object to focus on:

- I found that many of the objects were in glass cases against the wall, which prevented me from going all the way around them
- The lighting was very bad in the exhibits, as it was pretty dark to set a sense of atmosphere
    - This made it difficult to get an acurate image, as it was too dark to pick up equally around the objects
- I was able to practice with the app a great deal and determine that textured, well lit objects are easier to create 3D models with

I decided I will look at the Art Gallery downtown for a sculpture I can use
