# Art Gallery

January 25, 2018

I went to the National Gallery of Canada downtown to look for an object:

- There weren't a lot of free standing sculptures
- The lighting wasn't ideal and most of the sculptures were too high to properly scan with the Trnio app
- I decided to go back to the Gallery during the day when there would be more light if I couldn't find a historical object at home
