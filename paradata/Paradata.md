# Paradata
---

I decided for my paradata section to answer the questions provided in the course FAQ section "[What is paradata?](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812w18/wiki/What-is-paradata%3F)" (Graham). 
1. Why has the resource been created and for what audience?
    - My 3D models of the Royal Doulton Churchill Toby Jug were created in order to learn how an object changes when going from the physical world to the digital world. 
    - They were also created for the purpose of completing Module 1 of HIST 3812
    - Their intended audience is primarily Dr. Graham. With other students in the course and people generally interested in history in mind as well. 


2. How will the resource be put to use? Is it suitable and accessible?
    - Right now the 3D models are only able to be viewed and manipulated by people on Sketchfab. 
    - They could be put to use as a historical resource, allowing people to interact and view the Jug as a more fully formed object than a 2D picture provides.
    - I think that the 3D models are accessible, as they have been made public on Sketchfab and people can easily interact with them.
    - The mode of having them as 3D models is ideal for a more interactive experience, but the models aren't perfect and need to be cleaned up in order to fully show all aspects of the original object.


3. Why have I chosen to use the approach/methods applied?
    - I chose to use DSLR photographs instead of the Trnio App because the app wasn't functioning properly.
    - I then chose to edit the photographs using 3D Paint because it is the function that came with my laptop, and was very easy to use. 
    - I chose to use Agisoft PhotoScan Pro, because it was discussed as working well with DSLR photographs in class, and it also had the option of a free trial.
    - I also chose to upload my final results to Sketchfab because it was similarly discussed in class and also had an easy to use uploading function with PhotoScan. 
    - Most of my decisions regarding programs and methods in creating my 3D models resulted from my having some knowledge of how they functioned beforehand. Which I them had to fully figure out.


4. What are the basic steps I followed in putting together this resource?
    - I began by choosing the object to create a 3D model of.
    - I decided on a Winston Churchill Toby Jug from 1940.
    - I then tried to use the Trnio Photogrammetry App to create a model of it.
    - The app wasn't working, so I decided to use a DSLR camera to take photographs instead.
    - Once the photographs were taken, I transfered them to my laptop.
    - Of the 113 photographs, I edited 102 of them using 3D Paint.
        - I used the "Magic Select" tool to select the object and separate it from the background of the photos.
        - I was then able to remove the background and save the photos with only the object showing.
    - I downloaded a free trial of Agisoft PhotoScan Pro in order to create 3D models from 2D pictures.
        - I uploaded the edited photos and followed a [tutorial](http://www.agisoft.com/pdf/PS_1.1%20-Tutorial%20(BL)%20-%203D-model.pdf) from the PhotoScan website
    - In following the tutorial, I created a mask of the object in each photo in order to separate the object from the blank background
    - I then tried to align the photos but ran into a issue where it wasn't really working.
        -  I decided to try with a smaller amount of photos, using only 71 of the 102 edited photos.
    - The second try worked, and I aligned the photos.
    - I then created a Dense Point Cloud, which helped to really visualize the 3D model.
    - I followed the Point Cloud by building a mesh and texture onto the model.
    - I then saved and exported the model directly to my Sketchfab account using my API.
    - Once the second attempt was complete, I returned to the first and was able to successfully try again, using the same steps. 


5. What supporting evidence did you rely upon?
    - I don't know if I really used much evidence in making my 3D model.
    - I suppose that I mostly relied upon my own trial and error while following the tutorial, seeing what was working and trying to fix what wasn't working.
    - I feel that seeing each step come into play helped to really envision the final result, as the masks, alignments, dense point clouds, etc. were added the more confident I became in the possibility of the final resulting model. 

6. How have you acknowledged uncertainty in the resource? Where might there be alternative interpretations otherwise available for viewing audiences to refer to?
    - I feel that I have acknowledge uncertainty in my paradata, as well as my github repository for Module 1. I recorded my thoughts in my process notes, and acknowledged the flaws in my models.
    - I am aware that I am a beginner when it comes to creating 3D models. I am thus quite pleased with my first attempts and aware that there is most definitely room for improvement. 
    - I am not sure if there are any alternatives for audiences to refer to in terms of this particular object. There are 2D images of Churchill Toby Jugs available online, but I do not think there are any 3D models for people to compare mine to. 

I feel that my 3D models of a 1940 Royal Doulton Winston Churchill Toby Jug were overall successful. I was able to create models using 2D photographs, teaching myself as I went along how to use the programs and figuring out the best techniques to use. I hope that I will be able to further my knowledge in this area, as creating 3D models of artifacts and historically significant objects is something I see as very important for ensuring the accessibilty and the spread of historical knowledge.
